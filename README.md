# Library of Twitter

Inspired by [the Library of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel), the goal of this project is to provide a generator of tweets, using a random combination of 274 characters (5 are reserved for the hashtag " #lot", and the last one is a trailing space character inserted by Twitter). Allowed characters include the 26 lower case letters of latin alphabet, comma, period and space.
